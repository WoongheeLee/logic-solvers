- Prover9 is developed by the original authors and can be found at [Prover9 and Mace4](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/prover9/).
- The modifications to the Makefile in `/provers.src` are aimed at resolving the 'round' function error for specific GCC compiler versions. This modification is based on solutions such as the one discussed in this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39472662/c-round-function-is-throwing-error-undefined-reference-to-round).
